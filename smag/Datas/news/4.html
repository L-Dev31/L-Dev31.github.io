<p>The SMAG logo has been the visual identity of our project since its very beginning. Over the past five years, it has evolved alongside our development skills, reflecting the growth and maturity of the Super Mario Another Galaxy project.</p>
<br>
<p>Today, we want to take you on a journey through the evolution of our logo, from its humble beginnings in 2020 to the polished design we use today in 2025.</p>
<br>
<p>Each iteration tells a story of <strong>artistic growth</strong>, <strong>technical improvement</strong>, and our team's dedication to creating something that truly represents the spirit of SMAG.</p>
<br>
<h3>2020: The Beginning</h3>
<p>Our journey started in 2020 with our very first logo attempt. Like many first attempts, it was quite basic, but it carried the essence of what we wanted to achieve. Fun fact: the logo was made entirely in Pixellab on Android, for those who know! :p</p>

<h3>2021: Refining the Vision</h3>
<p>By 2021, <strong>Solargress</strong> had joined the team and brought a fresh perspective to our logo with his Photoshop skills at the time.</p>

<h3>2022: Finding Our Style</h3>
<p>The 2022 logo was the one that lasted the shortest time. It was actually <strong>L-Dev</strong>'s first attempt at creating a 3D logo in Blender.</p>

<br>
<h3>2023-2024: Professional Polish</h3>
<p>From 2023 to 2024, our design skills had matured significantly. The logo received a major overhaul that brought it much closer to a traditional SMG logo style.</p>

<h3>2025: The Current Masterpiece</h3>
<p>And here we are in 2025 with our current logo, the culmination of five years of design evolution and refinement. It was rendered in 3D through Blender and is heavily inspired by the new <strong>Super Mario Galaxy, the Movie</strong>.</p>

<br>
<h3>The Design Philosophy Behind SMAG</h3>
<p>Throughout this five-year evolution, several core principles have guided our logo design:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>SMG Identity:</strong> Every version maintains a connection to SMG but must feel like a true glow up.</li>
    <li><strong>Readability:</strong> The logo must be clear and legible at any size</li>
    <li><strong>Professional Quality:</strong> Matching Nintendo's quality standards as close as possible.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
<p>While we're incredibly proud of our current logo, we know that design is never truly finished. As SMAG continues to evolve and grow, so too might our visual identity.</p>
<br>
<p>But for now, our 2025 logo stands as a testament to five years of hard work, creativity, and the unwavering dedication of the SMAG team to creating something truly special.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Here's to many more years of SMAG adventures!</strong></p>
