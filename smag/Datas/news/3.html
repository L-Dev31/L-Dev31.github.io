<p>As of today, I can no longer say that I am a beginner in SMG 3D modeling. I see myself polishing models so intensively that someone who hasn't played SMG or SMG2 in a long time couldn't tell my models weren't official Nintendo creations.</p>
<br>
<p>But it clearly wasn't a one day adventure.</p>
<br>
<p>I personally think that if I made it to this point, it's largely due to my <strong>exaggerated perfectionism</strong> which forced me to never use anything unless I could call it "parfait en tout point" (perfect in every way). This, I assume, made SMAG's development so lengthy that it could be a AAA game today if it wasn't a mod made by fanboys/nerds like us, and especially if we already knew everything we know today (and more...).</p>
<br>
<p>With this long introduction, let's now look at the advancement of my 3D modeling journey...</p>
<br>
<h3>The Very Beginning: SketchUp Era</h3>
<p>Here are some of my first 3D importing tests. They were mainly made on SketchUp, and at this time everything felt like a NASA cockpit, to be frank.</p>
<br>

</p>
<br>
<p>I agree... it doesn't look like anything, but for me it was already too much to comprehend at that time.</p>
<br>
<h3>First Real Model: The Blender Breakthrough</h3>
<p>Then here we go with my first ever 3D model made on Blender. If I'd open it today and examine it, I'd be deeply horrified, this model had a ton of wasted resources (overly duplicated faces, etc.) but it already looked like something, I must say.</p>
<br>
<p>I've got to be honest: <strong>it is this model that made me want to start SMAG</strong>. When I looked at it, it was so good compared to everything else I had made that I thought this model alone could beat any of Louis Miles' work! (laughs) Also, this is thanks to <strong>Alex SMG</strong> that I managed to make that model and develop a passion for 3D modeling with his "How to import a model in SMG" tutorial that featured a quick session on Blender.</p>

<br>
<p>Oh, and let's not forget <strong>FRANCE!</strong></p>

<br>
<h3>Phase 1: The Copying Phase, Learning from the Masters</h3>
<p>This is where it really gets interesting. This was the time I had only one thing in mind: <strong>"be better than any other SMG 3D modeler."</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Not gonna lie, this is not really possible, each one of us has widely different styles, and I couldn't name a #1 modeler among all of us, except maybe <strong>Louis Miles</strong>, who has a style that I truly adore and love to analyze before starting a new model.</p>
<br>
<p>Let's get back to the topic... In this period, it was simple for me: I was copying every model I looked at. I remember copying:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Kairos'</strong> circular shaped planet</li>
    <li><strong>Into the Gateway</strong> planet from SMG for the spherical one</li>
    <li><strong>SMGravity demo's</strong> first planet for the odd shaped one</li>
    <li><strong>Gusty Garden's</strong> first planet for the UFO shaped model</li>
    <li><strong>SMG2's</strong> first planet for the planet with fences</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Here are some attempts from that early copying period:</p>

</p>
<br>
<h3>Phase 2: The Sleepless Nights, Passion Over Reason</h3>
<p>Following that period, not much changed really, except maybe my skills became much more pronounced while still very low and unusable. It was a period where I remember being a <strong>stupid, stupid kid</strong> and avoiding sleep totally to make unthought models that had no level design really, even though they had some... interesting concept arts that I would make.</p>
<br>
<p>I remember <strong>skipping a day of school</strong> to finish a very bad level section we called "Boying Boying Planet" with my German friend <strong>LiQ</strong>. Although yeah, I have to be honest, this was a very long period...</p>
<br>
<p>Here's a comprehensive look at this sleepless period, so many models, so much learning. And here's that infamous "Boying Boying Planet" I mentioned skipping school for:</p>

<h3>Phase 3: Coconut Beach Era, Personal Inspiration</h3>
<p>Let's continue with... OH, is that... <strong>Coconut Beach</strong>?!</p>
<br>
<p>Well yeah, only the biggest fans among you (not many, is there?) might have recognized it. This is where CB started. CB was for me a very important galaxy to make because I wanted to transcribe in it the wonder I felt as a kid when I would discover lakes and hidden wild beaches in the <strong>Var region</strong> around Le Muy, particularly for the rivers, and in my island (<strong>Guadeloupe</strong>) too.</p>
<br>
<p>Here are some models from this period where I started exploring more personal and meaningful concepts:</p>
<br>
<p><img src="Images/screenshots/3d-modelling-journey/3/3 (1).png"></p>
<br>
<p>As you can see, it really evolved with time. Let's see how much:</p>

</p>
<br>
<h3>Phase 4: Updown Ruin Era, Expanding Horizons</h3>
<p>During this period, I started working on more complex and ambitious projects. One of the major galaxies I was developing was <strong>Updown Ruin</strong>, which pushed me to explore new modeling techniques and more intricate level designs.</p>
<br>
<p>Here are some showcases from the Updown Ruin development period:</p>

</p>
<br>
<h3>Phase 5: The Thief Phase, Learning Through Mistakes</h3>
<p>This next period was a bit more annoying. I started to get frustrated from not being able to progress fast enough toward my goal, so I ended up doing more than copying...</p>
<br>
<p>Cover your ears... I began <strong>STEALING</strong>. Effectively, I'd find good models and put some assets from them into my own models. During that time, if there was a day without having <strong>Alex SMG</strong> criticizing me about this, then it was not a day! (lmfaodhskjhdkqs..)</p>
<br>
<p>Here are some examples from my "asset borrowing" phase:</p>
<br>

</p>
<br>
<h3>Phase 6: The Vertex Shading Revolution</h3>
<p>This next step is truly the beginning of how "good" I became. It was in great part due to the fact I'd give much more care to my nowadays favorite tool: <strong>vertex shading</strong>!</p>
<br>
<p>This was the turning point where I discovered the power of proper lighting and shading:</p>
<br>

</p>
<br>
<h3>Phase 7: Current Mastery Level</h3>
<p>At this point, it was only a matter of time and effort before reaching the level I always pursued. The models started looking more and more professional, and finally, here are some examples of my current work, the level I always dreamed of reaching:</p>
<br>
<p>

    <br>
    <img src="Images/screenshots/3d-modelling-journey/7/7 (5).png">
</p>
<br>
<p>Well, this took me <strong>5 years of my small life</strong>, but looking at these results, I can say it was completely worth it. Current SMAG models showcase the culmination of this entire journey, from those early SketchUp experiments to professional-grade 3D artistry that rivals official Nintendo work (at the very least from back then).</p>
<br>
<h3>Conclusion: From Dreams to Reality</h3>
<p>From those humble and sometimes questionable beginnings, every mistake taught me something valuable. Every copied model helped me understand geometry better. Every sleepless night spent modeling built my passion and determination.</p>
<br>
<p>Today, looking back at this journey, I can say that <strong>perfectionism</strong>, while sometimes slowing down development, pushed me to constantly improve and never settle for "good enough."</p>
<br>
<p>The canceled models you see here weren't failures, they were stepping stones. Each one brought me closer to the level of quality you see in SMAG today.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>The lesson?</strong> Every expert was once a beginner. Every professional was once an amateur. The key is to never stop learning, never stop improving, and always remember where you came from.</p>
<br>
<p>Thank you for following this journey with me. Here's to many more years of creating amazing 3D worlds for everyone to enjoy!</p>
