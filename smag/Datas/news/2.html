<p>Hey! Floaty here. You may know me as working on a few different mods for Super Mario Galaxy 2, Super Mario 3D World, and even Super Mario Odyssey. Today I'm proud to explain the backdoor development of my favorite SMAG level, <strong>Space Port Galaxy</strong>!</p>
<br>
<p>This level, which started all the way back in 2022, is a difficult stage inspired by Dreadnought Galaxy. In fact, the original version from back in the day took a lot of parts from the original Dreadnought.</p>

<p>Recently, I felt it was time to finally go back to Space Port Galaxy and give it the glow up it deserved. After making some quick concepts, I opened up Blender and started making the new and improved Space Port, and I was able to do everything from planning to final touches in just under 2 days! I'm very happy with how it turned out, and I hope you do too! <strong>Note:</strong> The model is still subject to change in the future.</p>

<br>
<p>As of now, not too much is done besides the main model, but there are many more plans I have with Space Port. A couple sections I have made are a section where you have to platform across rotating gears and yellow mechanical moving platforms in 2D, a section where you have to essentially play the game 'Hole In The Wall' from Minecraft, but with explosive missiles, and even a section involving a computer terminal!</p>
