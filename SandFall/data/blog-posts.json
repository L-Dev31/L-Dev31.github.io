      "excerpt": "It's been more than a year since the last blog post - and yet so many things happened in the meantime!",
      "content": "Hi there! It's been more than a year since the last blog post - and yet so many things happened in the meantime!\n\nIn April 2021, Sandfall moved from Paris to Montpellier and the core team working on Project W started to expand. We were 6 before that time, we're now more than 15 people to work on the game! Some of us even work from Sweden or Turkey.\n\nWe still believe time has come for small indie teams to deliver high quality realistic 3D premium games, thanks to the amazing tools that are now accessible to them. And we're getting closer to that goal every day! Brace yourselves, Unreal Engine 5 is also on its way to our pipelines...\n\nWe're now very close to finish Project W's vertical slice demo: more than one hour of gameplay, featuring pretty much everything we wanted to see in the game.\n\nIf you're a professional from the industry, be sure to poke us before the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, we'll be onsite to showcase the game! Guillaume, François and Tom will be making the trip from March 21st to 25th.\n\nLast but not least, we'd like to add a special thanks to great companies and institutions who gave their trust and support to Sandfall Interactive's Project W:\n\nEpic Games, for their $50,000 Epic MegaGrant to Project W.\n\nThe CNC (French national center for cinema), for their huge financial support, through preproduction financial support and tax rebate.\n\nThe Occitanie Region, in which Sandfall is located, which also provided additional funds for preproduction.\n\n...And of course, thanks to all of our friends, family and business angels who put their trust and money in the project from the very beginning!\n\nSee you soon and stay safe, from all the Sandfall team.",

      "content": "Hi there, long time no see! We've been working super hard for 12 months, since the latest blog update. But check this out:\n\n- The Sandfall team has grown from 12 to 22 skilled and talented people: programmers, artists, operations & producing support...\n\n- We increased collaboration with top industry freelancers and experts on specific missions, such as animation and lighting, to deliver outstanding graphics and art.\n\n- Project W now runs fully on Unreal Engine 5, we explore and make full use of new features like Lumen and Nanite.\n\n- We're heading to new offices, in an early-20th century mansion just 5 minutes by foot from Montpellier's historical city center. We aim to transform the place into a unique creative venue for employees and collaborators.\n\nAll of this is made possible by a new partnership sealed with Kepler Interactive, a new major global publisher co‑owned and run by developers, which will publish Sandfall's Project W.\n\nSandfall Interactive and Kepler Interactive are currently attending the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, feel free to reach out to us!",

      "content": "Hello Expeditioners!\n\nAfter years of work behind the scenes, we're so excited to finally reveal our first game, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as the trailer premiered during yesterday's Xbox Showcase!\n\nJoin Gustave, Maelle, and their fellow Expeditioners as they embark on a desperate quest to break the Paintress' cycle of death!\n\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33, or \"Expedition 33,\" is an RPG with real-time mechanics set in a world inspired by one of our native country's famous periods, the French Belle Époque. The game is published by Kepler Interactive (thanks again for your support!) and is currently in development for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation 5, and PC.\n\nWhile making this game, we were inspired by our beloved fantasy JRPGs and action games alike.\n\nExpedition 33 is an innovative reactive turn-based RPG with real-time offensive and defensive commands to enhance combat, making battles more challenging than ever. You will need to master offensive skills and magical abilities, dodge, parry, and counter enemy assaults in real time! We're also adding a ranged free-aim system to target enemy weak points to overcome overwhelming odds.\n\nWe sincerely hope you will enjoy discovering the world, the story, and the characters we crafted with love these past years. As we also wanted the best look to match our visual ambitions, we chose Unreal Engine 5 to create the game as we imagined it!\n\nBreak the cycle. Lead the Expedition.\n\nLove from the Sandfall Team.",
