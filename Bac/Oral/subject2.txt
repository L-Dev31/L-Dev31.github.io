When users say "simple", they mean to describe something incredibly easy to use. But easy to use doesn't equal easy to create
and that's the main complexity of simplicity
the great product just feels good and look all understandable from the first glance, you won't need a manual to manage it,
you just need to look at it.
today no matter the level of complexity a device represents, anyone is more and more meant and capable to use it because of it's interface
Design patterns: humans are creatures of habits, when something deviates from it, it looks off, designs that work among most people become 
design rules
technologie went from scary nerd nasa cockpit thing despite being extremely simple in it's functions to today becoming extremely simple
and accessible for anyone of any ages:
0- CLI (terminal, msdos etc...) then Primal VGA display, then windows 95 cold user interface due to capacity (gray colors, square effect on button etc...)
1- Frutiger Aero Windows XP etc... : copying what people knew in real life + animations etc... basically it had to feel like the mirror of our life on a screen
realistic bookshelf, wallet etc...
2- Minimalism : make it the simplet possible to make anyone apreciate it and understand it (less details = less possible confusions)
3- Liquid Glass design Eurovision and Coco Cola dot designs : Bringing the minimalism to more details, minimalism is boring
lets bring some details to minimalism to keep the aim of minimalism and bring it some life

Changing the society with user interface is art 

Flat design is an off shoe of simple Swiss Design

The ideal way to go for ideal design for society and users is inbetween minimalism and maximalism not too simple not to make tehcnology look
boring and soulless and not too complex to not make it nerd nasa cockpit stuff, Nintendo mastered it with Dsi Wii and WiiU and 3DS

the true force of a man and computer interface is to make anything feel natural, the wii for exemple was the console with internet and motion control
so they made the home menu a TV like interface with channels that were each programs like the news channel forecast channel etc...
it felt natural and at first galnce you directly understood that you had to use your controller like a TV controller since it also looked like
one point at the tv and realise you had a cursor that you would use to go in a game chanel etc... it is the art of bringing complex concepts
to anyone as something more than easy without needing any explanations

same with WiiU bringing community with the wara wara plaza on which you could see other people's mii talking about their gaming experience etc...

MAC went from being used to replace computer ladies for war (not open to anyone at all) to companies and universities (still not open but enough to be used by anyone passionated and educated enough)
then for homes for programming gaming and other niche tasks at the time, then the more it evolved the more people had to be able to use it
therefore making a simple and natural interface to literally anyone from the scientist to the baby

apple lisa first user interface

first computer mouse : macintosh 

iMac: first customisable computer case

internet brought more people to use computers from teenagers to companies so the MAC interface had to be developped for anyone

wimp window icon... the first user interface standard brought in first time with windows 1.01

today windows for exemple is excellent for almost any tasks and it's user interface allows easy control over all of them even for begginers 

User interface is the number one reason which define the people using a system, a system with less widely simple user interface like 
Arch Linux who has almost no begginer or random people using it in opposite of Chrome OS or Windows 11 being begginer friendly and allowing 
anyone even the less tech savvy to use it
